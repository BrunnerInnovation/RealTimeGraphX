# RealTimeGraphX
RealTimeGraphX is a data type agnostic, high performance plotting library for WPF, UWP and soon, Xamarin Forms.

The library core components are built using .Net Standard which makes it portable to a range of platforms.

Typical use case is, scientific measurements applications which requires real-time display with large data volumes.

RealTimeGraphX has a number of built-in data point types (axis) like Double, Float, Int32 and TimeSpan, but you can easily implement any kind of custom data type by inheriting and implementing the mathematical logic for that type.
